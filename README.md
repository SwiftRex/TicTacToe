# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe using SwiftRex, with random+CoreML+Minimax opponent Middlewares

This is work-in-progress, and although it works, it has some UI glitches, CoreML model is very dumb and Minimax is yet to be implemented.
Starting, restarting, victory count, timer, level-picker, avatar-picker, human vs human mode and much more is planned but yet to be developed.
